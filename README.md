# SQL-Demonstration
A simple project to help demonstrate SQL knowledge and to keep any notes or refreshers I might need.

## The process
Here's some of the initial ideas around starting this project:
  * Create an AWS database to be able to interact with
  * Use a jupyter notebooks to access the database. This will enable me to demonstrate the SQL input as well as the output and save it somewhere easily accessible.
  * Find raw data on Kaggle. Writing every line of the database is going to be a fruitless excercise, would be more efficient to take a series of csv file from Kaggle
  * Visualise some of the data using PowerBI. Unncertain if PowerBI files can be uploaded to github, if not use pdf files for the output.
